- project: POS Terminal Password Inference Model 
  role: 
  duration: Oct. 2016 &mdash; July 2017
  # url: "#"
  description:  <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Developed an password inference model which analyses physical layer data in wireless signals to infer passwords entered on a POS terminal.</li><li>Proposed a novel keystroke segmentation algorithm to improve the classification accuracy, and made use of PCA technique and Support Vector Machine with time series kernel which was originally used in this field</li></ul>
